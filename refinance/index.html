                  (Amended as of May 16, 2019)

                  <h4>PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES</h4>

                  <p> This Web site is not directed at persons under the age of 18. No information collected from
                     children is knowingly used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or
                     outside of this website. By registering on this Site through the submission of the information
                     requested, you agree that the following terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy shall govern
                     our use and disclosure of your personal information. When you register with this website, you
                     explicitly authorize us to share your information. If you do not agree with the terms and
                     conditions of our Privacy Policy, please do not complete the information request form (i.e., do not
                     register) or otherwise use or access this Site. If you have already registered by completing the
                     information disclosure forms, and you wish to opt-out from receiving more information from us,
                     please click on this link to "Opt-out." Your e-mail address will be added to the suppression files
                     associated with this Site within ten (10) business days of your request. Thereafter, you should not
                     receive any email correspondence from us. However you will still receive promotional communications
                     from our third party partners with whom we have shared your information. To stop receiving further
                     communications from these third parties you will need to contact them directly in order to opt-out.
                     Please note when you opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us, we will no longer
                     make your information available to our third party partners.

                     This Privacy Policy describes in some detail the information that we collect from you as part of
                     the normal operation of our service, and what may happen to the information we collect.

                     <h3> Your privacy is very important to us</h3>
                     We understand that some of the information that you might provide on our Site is personal and
                     private. By submitting your personal information, you are entrusting us to handle information that
                     you regard as private, for the purposes and in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy. In
                     exchange for your trust, you expect us to handle your personal and private information in a
                     professional manner that will be in keeping with your trust. Our Privacy Policy explains what
                     information we obtain on this Site, and how we use the information disclosed to us to link you to
                     our business affiliates who have expressed a willingness to provide you with the products and
                     services associated with this Site.

                     <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                     We are an on-line consumer service that introduces persons such as yourself to certain of our
                     business affiliates who have expressed a general willingness to review your information and
                     determine if they are willing to provide you with the services or products that prompted you to
                     visit our Site. When you visit our Site, you will be requested to complete provide certain
                     information that our business affiliates request in order to perform a preliminary analysis of your
                     qualifications to receive the service or products. Based upon your consent, as evidenced by your
                     registering with us on this Site (i.e., your submission of the requested information on the
                     application), we will forward the information that you provided to certain of our business
                     affiliates.

                     In addition, from time to time, we or our business affiliates may provide you the additional
                     service (the "Premium Service") of sending you e-mail you or otherwise corresponding with you to
                     inform you of additional opportunities to receive special offers for other services and/or products
                     that we believe may be of interest. There are no fees for Premium Service, and you are under no
                     obligation to accept any service or product with any of our business affiliates offered under the
                     Premium Service.

                     <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                     The information that we collect is generally limited to personal information about you that our
                     business affiliates consider necessary for performing a preliminary evaluation of your
                     qualifications. To the extent that you can order products, enter contests, express an opinion, or
                     subscribe to a service(s), the type of personally identifiable information that may be collected
                     may include: name; address; e-mail address; telephone number; fax number; credit card information;
                     information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services; education
                     level; educational interests; home owner status; income; debt level; current mortgage; mortgage
                     rate and the like. To the extent that you are requested and you do submit information about other
                     people, such information will be limited recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone
                     number.

                     We also collect user information that can help us optimize and enhance your experience on our Site;
                     as well as provide you with an efficient, safe, smooth, and customized experience. For example, if
                     you came to this Site from an online banner ad, pop-up or other advertisement, an anonymous
                     identification number may be passed to our Site. In some cases, we may place a cookie in your
                     browser. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather any personally
                     identifiable information about you, but it will allow us to track the overall effectiveness of our
                     online advertising campaigns. We also automatically track certain information with respect to your
                     behavior on the Site through the forgoing cookie or identification number. This non personally
                     identifiable information may include the Internet address or URL that you just came from and which
                     URL you go to next; your computer browser information; and your IP address. We use this non
                     personally identifiable information in conjunction with some of the information that you provided
                     to us to do internal research on our users' demographics and behavior; and to better understand how
                     to best serve other users of this Site. Third parties may also set cookies on our sites to
                     determine proper site usage and click count.

                     We also utilize Web Logs to track aggregate information about how our site is being used. Web Logs
                     track anonymous user information, including but not limited to the number of visitors to our site,
                     operating systems and browser type. Unlike cookies, Web Logs are maintained only on our servers and
                     do not store or place anything on the user's computer.

                     <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
                     We collect the information that you submit and which our business affiliates consider necessary for
                     performing a preliminary evaluation of your qualifications for their products and services. Prior
                     to sending your information to our business affiliates, we attempt to validate it. For example, we
                     may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions, and accuracy based upon
                     past usage and response; or compare your information against other publicly available files; or
                     validate some of the personal information submitted to verify that the information inputted has a
                     high probability of being valid information.

                     After we submit your information to our business affiliates, our business affiliates may begin a
                     separate and independent evaluation of the information you submitted (the "Preliminary
                     Application"). If our business affiliates find that the Preliminary Application meets with their
                     more specific acceptance criterion, they may contact you directly by phone, mail or e-mail. For
                     more information on how our business affiliates will handle your personal information, please visit
                     our business affiliate's website, and review their privacy policy. We are not responsible for the
                     privacy practices or the content of our business affiliates' Web sites.

                     Once you have registered with us, you are automatically enrolled to receive our Premium Service. We
                     use the information you provided, along with other information described below, to create a general
                     user profile. This profile can be created by combining your information with other sources of
                     information such as information obtained from public databases, or from your browsing habits
                     surrounding your visit to this Site.

                     We may use personal information to provide the services you've requested, including wireless
                     services that display customized content and advertising. In addition to any fee of which you are
                     notified, your provider's standard messaging rates apply to our confirmation and all subsequent SMS
                     correspondence. You may opt-out and remove your SMS information by sending "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to
                     the SMS text message you have received. If you remove your SMS information from our database it
                     will no longer be used by us for secondary purposes, disclosed to third parties, or used by us or
                     third parties to send promotional correspondence to you.

                     <h3>The Do Not Track browser settings</h3>
                     Advertisers may collect data about your online browsing activity and use it to show you targeted
                     ads (a process known as "behavioral advertising”).

                     You can prevent companies from showing you targeted ads by submitting opt-outs to those service
                     providers.

                     Opting-out will only prevent targeted ads so you may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads)
                     from these companies after you opt-out.

                     <h3>WE MAY USE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE, INCLUDING
                        SELLING OR TRANSFERING SUCH INFORMATION AT ANY TIME TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE
                        PURPOSE.</h3>
                     For example, we may share your personal information with select business affiliates so that they
                     can contact you and offer you products and or services that we believe might be of interest to you.
                     This may include e-mail advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, and online banner
                     advertising to name a few. In addition, we may maintain separate e-mail, mailing or phone lists for
                     different purposes based on the information that you submitted and that we maintain. For your
                     information, our business affiliates have all agreed to operate in accordance with federal and
                     state laws and regulations relating to the handling of your personal information. You may learn
                     more about any of our business affiliate's privacy policy by visiting our business affiliates' Web
                     sites at such times as such affiliate may contact you. We are not responsible for the privacy
                     practices or the content of our business affiliates' Web sites. If you wish to end any e-mail
                     correspondence from us, you will need to Opt-out from receiving further correspondence by advising
                     us of your decision to Opt-out by clicking a link in the e-mail to our Opt-out procedures. Within
                     ten (10) business days, your e-mail address will be placed on a suppression list and we will no
                     longer correspond with you by email or resell or transfer your information to third parties. If you
                     wish to end future correspondence with any of our business affiliates, you will need to follow the
                     instructions at the end of any such each e-mail message from them to unsubscribe from such business
                     affiliate's e-mail. You are able to opt-out when registering with us.

                     We may also disclose your personally identifiable information in response to a subpoena, court
                     order, or other legal process; as well as the transfer or sale of personally identifiable
                     information pursuant to the sale of our business or assets. Should such a combination or
                     acquisition occur, we will require that the new combined or acquiring entity follow this privacy
                     policy with respect to your personal information. If we transfer ownership of the site to another
                     company, we will notify you by email or by general notice on our site. In addition to the forgoing,
                     we may also sell, transfer or share non-individualized information, such as summary or aggregated
                     anonymous information about all persons or sub-groups of persons visiting this site.

                     We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never
                     be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, third parties may
                     unlawfully intercept personal data or access our servers and obtain personal data. Therefore,
                     although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, nor you
                     should not expect, that your personal information would always remain private.

                     Certain sensitive information such as credit card numbers or other information such as social
                     security numbers and drivers licenses ("Financial Information") collected on the site and
                     associated data is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software from the time it is
                     captured by our application to the time it is transmitted to our servers. For more information on
                     the encryption and protection of your information, please see How We Protect Your Privacy.

                     <h3>Application of this Privacy Policy</h3>
                     This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up on the website. We may sell the
                     personal information that you supply to us and we may work with other third party businesses to
                     bring selected retail opportunities to our members via direct mail, email and telemarketing. These
                     businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup
                     and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing

                     <h3>How We Protect Your Privacy</h3>
                     We protect your privacy in a number of ways. As an initial matter, any Financial Information
                     transmitted to our servers via a secure server is encrypted using SSL technology. SSL is a protocol
                     that transmits your communications over the Internet in an encrypted form. The protocol ensures
                     that the information is sent, unchanged, only to the server you intended to send it to.

                     Once your information reaches our server, it is protected by a firewall. With a firewall in place,
                     your information is virtually inaccessible to third parties. In addition to encryption and firewall
                     protections, we have all of our business affiliates agree to operate in accordance with federal and
                     state laws and regulations, including regulations relating to CAN-SPAM and rules promulgated by the
                     FTC. If we learn that any of our business affiliates are breaching our agreement, and therefore
                     your trust, we will take corrective actions immediately or terminate our relationship with such
                     business affiliate.

                     We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to
                     us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet,
                     or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use
                     commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its
                     absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can mail us at the
                     address indicated below in the Contact Us section.

                     <h3>Changes; Opting-Out</h3>
                     If you want to change the information that you submitted, please do so by making another request

                     our suppression file, will have their e-mail addresses checked against all correspondence to be
                     sent by us. Where there is a match, the planned email correspondence will be withheld, and such
                     person will receive no further email correspondence from us. Your e-mail address will be placed on
                     the suppression list associated with this Site within ten business (10) days of your request. Once
                     you have opted out, we will no longer forward you email from this site but we are not responsible
                     or in control of the business practices of our business affiliates who have been forwarded your
                     information.

                     <h3>Notification of Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
                     We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new privacy policy on the Site. Be sure

                     information practices change at some time in the future, we will use only data collected from the
                     time of the new privacy policy amendment forward for those new purposes. If we make material
                     changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home

                     <p>Written Agreement or Contract</p>
                     Wisdom does not act as your lender or broker. Wisdom forwards your information to our participating
                     Mortgage Originators who then contact you directly with their offers. Our services are provided
                     free of cost to you and we do not charge or attempt to collect any fees from you. Additionally,
                     Wisdom cannot guarantee the lowest price or best terms or rates available on the market. Our fees
                     are flat and are collected from our partners, the amount from which is not dependent upon whether
                     or not a loan is closed. This agreement remains in force only for as long as you use the services
                     offered by Wisdom. Should you discontinue this relationship, you will not incur any cost or
                     penalty.

                     Wisdom does not collect fees or any money from the consumer, thus, no escrow account is required.
